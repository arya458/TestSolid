i packaged the project by feature

in this app we have one feature and that's smsManager


for example if we where making a store app 

then we can package it or make a module for it like so 
    - store 
    - messenger
    - profile
    - Order( user can track order here)

i implemented the same approach in sandbox Android App with modules
